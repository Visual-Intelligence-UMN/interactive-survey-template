# A Template for Hosting Interactive Paper Survey Browsers (or Any Other Awesome Lists!)


## Overview

This codebase was originally developed to host [our ML4VIS Survey](https://ml4vis.github.io). 
We later received several requests about using the code base for hosting their own surveys, and thus modified it and created this repository. 

This repo is developed and tested using `node.js@16.10.0`

The original ML4VIS survey

Now, you can host customized surveys by simply modifying a JSON file (`assets/papers.json`).

## Creat and host your survey on GitHub page
#### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

Go to your forked repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab, and enable GitHub Actions by clicking the "Enable Actions" button.

#### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your forked repository.
2. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
3. Under "Source," select "Deploy from a branch."
4. Choose the `gh-pages` branch and click "Save."

#### 4. Update the repo to include your papers

- First, update the `papers.json` file to include your own list of papers (Detailed instructions can be found below). Add icon figures and paper figures as needed:

  - Store paper images in the `assets/paperImages/` directory.
  - Store icon images in the `assets/avatars` directory, named as `{dimension name}_{tag name}.png`. If an icon image is not specified, the first character of the tag name will be used as the icon by default.

- Second, update the `homepage` field in `package.json` to match your GitHub account:

  ```json
  "homepage": "https://{your-github-username}.github.io/interactive-survey-template/"
  ```
  Replace `{your-github-username}` with your actual GitHub username.

#### 5. Push Changes and Deploy
After making the necessary updates, commit your changes and push the changes to the main branch of your repository.
GitHub Actions will automatically start the deployment process once changes are pushed.
Once successfully deployed, your survey will be avaiable at `https://{your-github-username}.github.io/interactive-survey-template/`

#### 6. (Optional) Change the Repo name
If you needed to change the repository name to better reflect your survey ([how to rename a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository#)), 
please also update the `homepage` field in package.json 
```javascript
// inside package.json
  "homepage": "https://{your-github-username}.github.io/{your-new-repo-name}/"
  ```
 and the `basePath` variable in `src/index.tsx` 
```javascript
// inside src/index.tsx
export const basePath = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? '' : '/{your-new-repo-name}/';
```

Push the changes to your github repository, and the survey website will now be available at the new url [https://{your-github-username}.github.io/{your-new-repo-name}/](https://{your-github-username}.github.io/{}/).

## How to modify the JSON file

You can see a detailed example in `assets/papers.json`.
Below is an explanation of the JSON format.

```javascript
{
  "title": "", // The name of ypur survey, will show in the header
  "colors": ["#000", "orange"], // your homepage link
  "homepage": "",
  "preprint": " ", // preprint link
  "topTheme": "#333", // background of the top bar (hex or rgb or image url)
  // below is a list of papers
  "papers": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "venue": "",
      "year": 2024,
      "imagePath": "assets/paperImages/paper1.png", // optional field, if provided, show the image inside the paper card
      "url": "", // optional, a new tab of this url will be open when click the paper card. Otherwise, the new tab will show google search results of the paper name
      
      "others": { // optional field, if provided, key-value pair will display at the bottom of the paper card
        "authors": "",
        "doi": "xxx"
      },
      "dimension_one": ["tag 1", "tag 2"], // encodings of the paper
      "dimension_two": ["tag 1"]
    },
    {
        // paper 2
    },
    // other papers
    //...
  ]
}
```

**Add Paper Figures and Tag Icons**
- You can store paper images in the `assets/paperImages/ directory` and specify the path name in the imagePath.
- Icons images of tags can be stored in `assets/avators`,  with filenames in the format `{dimension name}_{tag name}.png`. If an icon image is not specified, the first character of the tag name will be used as the icon by default.


### Run the code in your local machine (for development)

We recommend using `node.js@16.10.0`. For installation instructions, refer to [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all). 

Install dependencies (only needed the first time) `npm install`

Run the code `npm run dev`.

Open `http://localhost:21002/` in your web browser.
